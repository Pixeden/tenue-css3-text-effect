# Tenue CSS
### Pixeden Playground

This is a subtle css `text-shadow` based effect inspired by [this](http://www.pixeden.com/photoshop-text-effects/tenue-psd-text-effect) version.

The effect creates a very elegant and stunning result with a mix of shadows and light. You can use your own text with ease and edit the effect to make it your own.
